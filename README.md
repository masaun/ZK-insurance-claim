# „ÄêIN PROGRESS„ÄëZK Insurance Claim on Swell Chain üõ°Ô∏è

## Tech Stack

- `ZK circuit`: Implemented in [`Noir`](https://noir-lang.org/docs/) powered by [Aztec](https://aztec.network/)) 
- Smart Contract: Implemented in Solidity (Framework: Foundry)
- Blockchain: [`Swell Chain`](https://build.swellnetwork.io/docs/guides/getting-started) (Testnet)

<br>

## Overview

- This is the Zero-Knowledge (ZK) based Insurance Claim protocol, which allow a patient to claim the medical payment coverage without revealing the sensitive information (i.e. exact treatment, treatment cost, coverage, etc) to a insurer by submitting a hospital bill proof (which is a ZK Proof).
